# You can only subclass from one class. But you can mix in as many modules as you'd like.

# If it's an "is-a" relationship, choose class inheritance. If it's a "has-a" relationship, choose modules. Example: a dog "is an" animal; a dog "has an" ability to swim.

# You cannot instantiate modules (i.e., no object can be created from a module). Modules are used only for namespacing and grouping common methods together.
